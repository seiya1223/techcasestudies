  `![Description of the image]({{site.baseurl}}/images/projectname/myimage.png)`

  Here’s an example: 

  `![Value Stream Mapping]({{site.baseurl}}/images/orckestra/orckestra2.jpg)`

3. Note that capitalization of the file name and the file extension must match exactly for the images to render properly.

## Smart, connected IoT golf grip with PGA Tour golfer Bryson DeChambeau ##
*By [Blain Barton](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/blainbar), Senior Technical Evangelist*

Microsoft technology partner [Sensoria, Inc.](http://www.sensoriafitness.com), professional golfer [Bryson DeChambeau](http://www.usopen.com/en_US/players/bios/47959.html), the Microsoft Developer and Evangelism team, and other golf partners recently collaborated to build a new high-tech IoT solution involving a smart, connected golf grip. Mike Downey, Principal Evangelist for Microsoft Sports Partnerships, sat down with Bryson early on to find out his important golf needs. Grip pressure was at the top of his list of requests and is an important factor in consistency that isn't measured by any other company.

The “Smart Grip” detects Bryson’s hand-on-grip position and levels of pressure, monitors his golf strokes on different clubs and relays real-time data to Microsoft Azure intelligent systems. The data is then rendered for Bryson on a Microsoft Surface with an elegant Universal Windows Platform Application using XAML and Microsoft Visual Studio.

## The challenge ##
In the game of golf, many factors impact the ability to consistently drive or putt a golf ball to its exact intended destination. One of these factors is the pressure (or force) with which the golfer grips the golf club. There are multiple theories on what the right pressure on grip should be, but they are all subjective and hard to quantify. Until now. By monitoring this variable, golfers who have developed consistency in gripping the club the same way at every stroke on the golf course have a distinct advantage over those who grip the club differently (too tightly or loosely) from hole to hole. Most golfers are inconsistent in their grip throughout the game or tournament due to factors such as stress, fatigue, etc. It is well known that a tight grip makes a golfer lose distance and often precision as well.

Consistency of grip during a drive or putt is key to predictably and repeatedly placing the ball at the desired location. The ability to measure consistency of grip—and provide confirmation to the golfer ahead of swinging the club—reduces (or removes) one of the many variables that ultimately affects where the golf ball lands. This allows golfers to focus on other variables that they have less control over, like wind speed and direction, condition and layout of the fairway, obstacles, etc.
 
## Solution ##
Responding to this challenge, Sensoria and Microsoft partnered to develop a “Proof of Concept” Smart Grip to measure the force/pressure exerted by Bryson’s hands on his [JumboMax](http://www.jumbomax.com) custom-developed golf grips, and provide him with valuable and actionable audio/visual feedback ahead of swinging the club, assisting him to achieve a consistent grip from swing to swing. The solution was built in less than eight weeks thanks to the Microsoft platform and the [Sensoria SDK](http://www.sensoriafitness.com/developer).  

The Smart Grip is powered by the ultra-light and powerful Sensoria® Core: a highly customizable piece of embeddable microelectronics weighing under half an ounce and measuring just one inch square. 

Sensoria Core allows elegant, rapid prototyping and creation of smart wearables, garments, sport accessories and many other IoT devices.

The [ARM® Cortex®-M4 processor](http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-m4-processor.php) is used as a high-performance embedded processor with DSP instructions developed to address digital signal control markets that demand an efficient, easy-to-use blend of control and signal processing capabilities. The processor is highly configurable, enabling a wide range of implementations from those requiring floating point operations, memory protection, and powerful trace technology to cost-sensitive devices requiring minimal area. It uses [the Keil RTX](http://www.arm.com/products/tools/software-tools/mdk-arm/middleware-libraries/rtx-real-time-operating-system.php), a royalty-free, deterministic Real-Time Operating System designed for ARM and Cortex-M devices. It allows you to create programs that simultaneously perform multiple functions and helps to create applications that are better structured and more easily maintained.

The Sensoria® Core relays real-time grip pressure from eight embedded pressure sensors in each grip. 
Data can be viewed in real time using the provided Universal Windows Application:

It also provides a wealth of data on club-movement in space (using its built-in accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a Universal Windows Platform Application.  
This application stores the data in the Sensoria Cloud powered by Microsoft Azure, and graphically renders pressure of the hands in relation to the golf grip on a Windows Surface device. 

Power BI was used to display data to the application during the swing analysis during the "proof of concept."

Lastly, Microsoft Visual Studio and XAML were used to build the application.

## Architecture ##
Since the pressure and movement data lives in the cloud, it can easily be leveraged to inform analysis for building new intelligent golf data streams for machine learning and in the future remote assisted coaching. 
From an architectural standpoint, this is how the system is designed:

SQL Database and other databases were used in the solution to capture pressure data.

The solution used Azure Stream Analytics for outputting from the Azure Event Hub to SQL Database.

## Conclusion and planned future phases ##
The "Proof of Concept" Smart Grip is now complete and is currently undergoing testing with Bryson DeChambeau. All parties learned a lot about golf strategies and equipment design in this new Sports Analytics space. We plan to revisit Bryson to review the data patterns that are being captured by the Smart Grip during his play. The data collected from Bryson over time will be analyzed during future phases of the project in a Machine Learning environment to build new intelligent golf data streams, helping him determine the right grip and club usage, swing speed, rhythm, plane, and other performance and swing-mechanics variables.

excerpt: Microsoft worked with Powel to establish DevOps practices for a new SmartWater solution.
language: English
verticals: [Energy, Public Sector]
---


In this DevOps hackfest, Microsoft teamed up with Powel to hack a brand-new
solution, **SmartWater**. We describe the process and the result here, including
the following DevOps practices:

-   Infrastructure as Code
-   Continuous integration / Continuous delivery
-   Test, staging, and production environments

Additionally, the team expressed a need for getting hands-on experience with:

-   Test automation
-   Branching strategies
-   Security modeling

The hackfest took place a few weeks after a Value Stream Map (VSM) session where we were able to identify some pain points and plan for
an improved workflow. The result was an estimated 50% reduction in lead time as well as a much higher degree of percent complete and accurate.

## DevOps practices implemented

During the hackfest, we implemented the following practices:

- Underwent a Value Stream Mapping session to find areas of improvement.
- Created a multi-team project with work flowing from one team to the next.
- Microservice approach to deliver software updates in a “fast ring” style without downtime.
- Defined acceptance criteria according to the ISO standards for software quality.
- Used the SDL and the Microsoft Threat Modeling tool to assess security risks early.
- Architected the code using Domain-Driven Design principles (DDD).
- Long-lived feature branching strategy, using Git as source control.
- Adhered to the SOLID principles of object oriented design.
- Developed code using a Test-Driven Development approach (TDD).
- Set up an automated build and test pipeline for each component of the solution (CI).    
- Release Management (CD+RM).
- A/B testing based on an opt-in policy.  
- Expecting to monitor running applications using Application Insights.
- Infrastructure as Code. 
- Used Slack as a collaboration tool between departments.

We worked long and hard during each day of the hackfest. Everyone was
high-spirited and excited about the work, and once Friday afternoon came, we had
a working proof-of-concept tying in all of the API components with the Web
Application and output from the Machine Learning algorithm.

## Customer profile


[Powel](http://www.powel.com/) spans Europe with a broad and sustainable customer base and a long history
as a trusted supplier of software solutions for cities / municipalities, counties,
the energy industry, as well as the contracting sector. Ca USD 50M revenue and
400 employees. The company has offices across Norway as well as in Sweden,
Denmark, Switzerland, Chile, Turkey and Poland.

## Focus of the hackfest


Powel is investing in a brand new, born-in-the-cloud solution for monitoring
water in municipalities (Smart Water for Smart Cities). Undetected /
underreported water leakage accounts for over 30% of water loss and is the
single biggest factor in lost water. Using smart meters deployed in some
municipalities (and other sources), Powel will monitor water through Azure’s IoT
Hub and analyze usage data to detect and predict maintenance issues. Detecting
water leaks and dynamically controlling water pressure throughout zones in
cities are the end goals of the product.

*Deeply focused team* 

![The team hacking]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/powel/teamHacking.jpg)



## Problem statement


Powel used a mix of older and newer tools and methods for source control,
quality control, tracking work, and communication and deployment. Products
include *GIT*, *Team City*, and *Octopus Deploy*.

The current software team has a lead time of just over 61 days on average, with
a %C&A of 0.8% in their existing projects.

The organization as a whole is divided along traditional lines (design, operations,
development, QA) and a significant challenge was to get this team to keep true
to the CI – QA – PROD mindset; to start thinking about deploy in the beginning
of the project and not at the end. Unit-Testing existed, but was unstructured,
and up to each developer. They had an awareness of best practices, but poor
or missing guidelines for how to do it. Powel would like to consider release
branching and feature toggling as well.

The challenges (areas of improvement) the Powel team has been facing can be
summed up as follows:

-   **Transforming** to support rapid delivery of new features to customers.
-   **Formalizing** test acceptance criteria.
-   **Assessing** risk on each feature delivered and establishing practices to
    document and counter them.

## Value Stream Map


The preparation for the DevOps hackfest involved assessing the current state of
a similar project’s software development lifecycle, looking for areas of
improvement, and focusing on the actual hack. During these phases, we narrowed
down which areas to improve and what to deliver, and then proceeded to just do
it!

### Value Stream Mapping team

The VSM session included the following people:

| Company   | Role                               |
| -------   | ----                               | 
| Powel     | Project lead                       | 
|           | Domain expert, water               |
|           | Stand-in for Atle Vaaland on day 1 |
|           | (future) CTO of Powel              |
|           | Head of R&D                        |
|           | Developer / Ops                    | 
|           | Operations lead                    |
|           | Developer                          |
| Microsoft | Technical evangelist               | 



### Current value stream

In our initial VSM session, the hackfest team discussed
the overall process, from feature definition to design, application development
cycle, technologies used, and routines for handing off from one stage to the
next.

*VSM of current development process done by the team*

![VSM of current development process done by the team]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/powel/e1fa47e4dcf290a731a46199c448da26.jpg) 


Because it is a completely new solution to be defined, we did not have an MVP
(Minimum Viable Product) yet defined, so we decided to focus on the team’s
existing development process and discussed ways to improve that.
 
*VSM, current state*

![VSM, Current State]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/powel/vsm_current.png)


#### Lead time vs processing time


The current value stream has a total completion lead time of just over 61
business days. Compared to the total processing time, this yielded a 30.1%
efficiency rate, meaning lead time represents 70% of that time.

#### Percent complete and accurate

The “*Percent complete and accurate*” (or simply: *%C&A*) measures how many
times a feature passes from one stage to the next without having to come back
for review, fix or other reason. The rolled value here indicates that few, if
any of the features being delivered today require rework at some point in the
flow (*rolled %C&A 0.8%*). This is not an exceptional result—many companies may
have as much as 100% of their flow requiring rework at some stage—but we will
be aiming to deliver a stronger number here in our future map.

### Future state value stream

Having spent most of the time discussing and learning about Powel’s current
software development process, we proceeded to design a “perfect” future state
value stream.

![Whiteboard image of future state]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/powel/70a9acda431da505414957b2d0247c48.jpg)


Because *SmartWater* is a greenfield project, the decision to scrap the current
way of development in favor of a complete redesign addresses the central points of
concern gave the following map:

*Future state VSM*

![Future State VSM]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/powel/vsm_future.png)


## Architecture

The SmartWater solution has a microservice architecture consisting of a web
portal that calls in to various underlying APIs. The web portal, as well as each
of the underlying APIs, are each defined as epics, and detailed in features within each. 
The idea being that future products will be able to call into these APIs.

![Overall solution architecture diagram]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/powel/architecture.png)


## Multiple teams across departments


In the hackfest, we introduced Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) as our overall
Application Lifetime Management (ALM) tool, allowing each department to track
changes to the product and structure their work into an effective flow between
the teams. The teams defined in VSTS are:

-   Design Team - Design of mocks and formulate acceptance criteria
-   Developer Team - Development of the feature, Test Automation
-   Ops Team - Deployment, Infrastructure and Load Tests
-   Analytics Team - Working with Machine Learning and advanced analytics

## Team workflows 


Each deliverable component in the solution is represented as an epic in VSTS.
Epics live outside all of the teams in the SmartWater project. When the need for
a feature within a component arises, that feature is added on a base level, and
then immediately assigned to the design team. A feature flows from one team to
the next until it is put into general release.

### Epic level workflow

We defined the following workflow for the components at epic level. Since each epic represents a 
deliverable component, the epic level items represent these component's lifetime.

![Epics lifecycle flow]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/powel/epicFlow.png)


### Features under epics

#### Feature definition

The features titles are written in a style similar to [Behavior Driven
Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) (BDD). ([Dan North](https://dannorth.net/about/) is considered by many as the father of BDD.) 
The idea is that a feature title should reflect the final outcome of said feature, i.e: 

"**The SettingsApi delivers the user's setting for Fast Ring deployment**"

This ubiquitous style gives everyone a very clear understanding of the feature just by looking at the title. 
Once the feature is pushed into production, a simple query in VSTS delivers a list of features that are in production. This way
everyone sees what the released product now can do.

*SettingsApi Epic has its own release, in which all features changed are shown* 

![VSTS Showing features released]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/powel/releaseExampleSettingsApi.png)


#### Feature creation

Features are created in a brainstorming session with marketing, designers,
developers, and operations.

The brainstorming session happens at epic level. Once defined, the features that
require the design team to do initial work are “transferred” to the design team
for acceptance criteria definition and production of design mocks. If it is a new feature for 
an API, it bypasses the designers, and is submitted directly to the developer team.

### Design team workflow

The design team carries their features across the following workflow:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/powel/designerFlow.png)

Each feature needs an interaction design before a graphical design can be
applied to it. Once these two design stages are done, the feature should be
complete enough for defining its acceptance criteria to answer the question:

-   “When is this feature regarded as complete?”

#### Acceptance criteria definition

The acceptance criteria should include the ISO standards [IEC 9126 / IEC 25010:2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_9126) for reference, among them:

-   Functional suitability/completeness
-   Reliability
-   Usability
-   Compatibility
-   Performance Efficiency
-   Maintainability
-   Security (Done by the developer team)

Once the design and acceptance criteria have been defined, the feature is placed
in “Review” status. The idea being that senior leadership reviews the work done
by designers and gives them the final “go.” This will not be a very formal
process initially, but marks good practice.

### Developer Workflow

The following flow helps management understand how the features are progressing.

![Developer Workflow]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/powel/developerFlow.png)

#### Threat modeling

Before the team starts to develop a feature, they create a threat model so that
any security issues can be added to the final acceptance criteria list. They do so using
the [Microsoft SDL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sdl/default.aspx), among them we demonstrated
the [Threat Modeling tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sdl/adopt/threatmodeling.aspx).

#### Planning session and user story creation

Before developers start working on a feature, they have a planning session where
user stories are appended to the feature. These user stories are then broken
into individual tasks that are easier to estimate. This is a built-in feature of
VSTS.

### Operations workflow

The operations workflow is simply Next Active Resolved (or Dismissed), as most
of the tasks involved in operations from a feature development are short-lived.
Operations also have the responsibility of monitoring a feature in production
environments, but that kind of operations does not have a development approach
and will be discussed later in this report.

### Analysis workflow

Like operations, the features that the analysis team develop are not as detailed
as the steps in design and development, and are kept to the simple form of Next
Active Resolved (alternatively Dismissed). A feature of an API may require work
done by the analysis team (such as adding an API to the Machine Learning model)
and thus, may be assigned to this team when required.

### Collaborating with Slack
------------------------

We decided to use the collaboration tool Slack<sup>tm</sup> as a tool to prepare for the
hackfest execution. With this, Powel had a project-specific discussion team that
was divided into the following topics:

| Topic           | Purpose            |
| -----           | -------            | 
| General         | General discussion |
| DevOps          | For discussions around code and operations |
| Dataweek        | Discussions around what kinds of data to use in the solution, and how to get them |
| MachineLearning | Discussions around Azure Machine Learning topics |
| VSTS            | Automated hook into VSTS for showing failed and passed builds |

These chat-rooms were, and still are, actively used by the project team members and Microsoft, as they provide an easy, informal way of discussing the project
in detail. It is particularly interesting to see how all the project stakeholders can see when builds pass/fail, a seemingly simple thing that brings
the stakeholders that much closer to the overall flow.

## Hosting model


Currently, the architecture is delivered as a set of individually hosted Azure
Web Apps, but is flexible enough to be built into Azure Service Fabric at a
later stage if cost becomes an issue. Each web API can be thought of as a
component in Service Fabric and deployed separately. Today, the team delivers
each web API to a hosted Web App in Azure.

## Domain-Driven Design structure


We organized the code in a [Domain-Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) (DDD) architecture, focusing on
the entities in the SmartWater solution, and the objects that operate upon them.
Thus, each component is built up as a collection of class libraries that
represent the different layers of execution: presentation, business, data, as
well as the domain that is common to all. This made a clean *[separation of
concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)* and organized the projects cleanly, allowing different developers to
do work in separate levels of the same feature.

*SettingsApi organized in a DDD structure*

![SettingsApi organized in a DDD structure]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/powel/d97c35121cf570a3449c70677f36d25a.png)


### SOLID principles of object-oriented design

In order to provide a satisfying degree of test automation, we adopted the [SOLID principles of object-oriented design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)). 
This was mainly done to produce code that can be easily tested in isolation.

This report doesn’t go into the details of the SOLID principles, as these are
regarded as the very fundamental principles for doing test-driven development.
The SOLID principles that we stressed over and over again during the hackfest
were:

-   [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle): Any class should have only ONE reason to be changed. Keep it simple!
-   [Open/Closed Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle): Any interface declaration is OPEN to expansion, but CLOSED to changes.
-   [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle): Essentially: the use of “new()” is
    banned. All depencencies are resolved using an IoC Container. Otherwise,
    test-driven approaches are impossible.

```csharp
    public class TenantManager : ITenantManager
    {
        private readonly IExceptionHandler _exceptionHandler;
        private readonly ITenantReader     _tenantReader;
        private readonly ITenantValidator  _tenantValidator;

        public TenantManager(ITenantValidator tenantValidator, ITenantReader tenantReader, IExceptionHandler exceptionHandler)
        {
            _tenantValidator  = tenantValidator;
            _tenantReader     = tenantReader;
            _exceptionHandler = exceptionHandler;
        }


        public async Task<Tenant> GetByIdAsync(string tenantId)
        {
            if (!_tenantValidator.Validate(tenantId).Passed)
                return null;

            return await _exceptionHandler.GetAsync(() => _tenantReader.GetByIdAsync(tenantId));
        }
    }
```


**Code:** The Single Responsibility Principle dictates that each class must only have a single reason to change. In the example above, the sole purpose of a *tenantManager* is to orchestrate the process of retrieving a *Tenant* object. In the example, this means validating the parameter and doing a central exception handling
around the call to the object that handles the IO operation. Validation, ExceptionHandling, and Reading are NOT part of its responsbilities, so these are injected using the 
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP), thus the *only* reason for doing a modification to this code is if the process itself requires a change (i.e., by introducing a log step).

### Source control

We selected a “long-lived feature branch” source control strategy. Each product
in the architecture is developed and maintained in a separate souce control
branch.

Each branch triggers its own build/release automation cycle into a CI runtime
environment where the product is immediately available for testing. Once a
feature is deemed OK for general release, it is merged onto the master branch,
but the branch itself lives on for further development.

*Conceptual overview of the branches in the solution*

![Conceptual overview of the branches in the solution]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/powel/branches.png)


>**Note:**
>
>This approach has issues. Merging common code with each of the APIs basically
>merges ALL the code from the master branch. We’re still searching for the
>optimal solution here, and have found one suggestion so far:
>
>Move all common code into versioned NuGet Library, and have each of the current
>branches become their own repositories.
>
>This is a trivial change to the existing application structure, and is probably
>already implemented by the time this report is released.

### Writing better commit messages

We adopted a strategy for writing commit messages that aims to complete the
following sentence with each commit:

*If this commit is applied, it will….***\<commit message describing the intent of the commit\>**

This made it easy to see the value-increase of each commit:

```git
8b8d955 Add a leakage zone polygon mapper
be9d70f Merge branch 'master'
f39ab34 Finish test coverage for ExceptionHandler
910e3c3 Fix errors in spatial polygon and dates in documentDb queries
c4b445b Limit the query to docDb to 100 items for performance
e49a077 Update the API to wrap the results in DataResult
a1c1877 Rename IsValid() to Validate()
caba32d Add tenantVerifier and dateVerifier
```
**Why:** The team was used to writing commit messages like "Added XX" or "Adjusted YY," which is already apparent 
in the code changes and did not bring any value to a person doing QA. With this approach, it is now plain to everyone
what the value added is. They can read (bottom up) how the product grows.

## Test Automation

We built the applications using a TDD approach, writing Unit-Tests for each bit
of production code. This was done to solidify the product and give an early
alert on breaking changes.

The unit tests are written in the style of [Roy Osherove](http://osherove.com/about/) as suggested in his book [The Art of Unit Testing](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Unit-Testing-examples/dp/1617290890). 

A base-class for unit testing make dependencies of the class under tested automatically mocked, so that the
hassle of unit-tests goes away. The base class uses the NuGet package [StructureMap.AutoMocking.Moq](https://www.nuget.org/packages/structuremap.automocking.moq) to achieve this:

````csharp
public class ExceptionHandlerTests : TestsFor<ExceptionHandler>
{
    [Fact]
    public void Get_FunctionIsNull_DoesNotInvokeLogger()
    {
        // Arrange            
        Func<int> nullFunction = null;

        // Act           
        Instance.Get(nullFunction);

        // Assert
        GetMockFor<ILogger>().Verify(o => o.LogExceptionAsync(It.IsAny<Exception>(), It.IsAny<string>()), Times.Never());
    }
}
```

**Code sample:** *Test automation ensures the logic of the application is always verified during builds* 

Another nice NuGet package named [Should](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Should/) gave us a natural-language form of writing assertions that 
everyone instantly adopted:

````csharp
    [Fact]
    public async Task GetAsync_ValidFunction_ReturnsExpectedResult()
    {
        // Arrange
        Func<Task<int>> simpleFunction = () => Task.FromResult<int>(1313);

        // Act           
        var results = await Instance.GetAsync(simpleFunction);

        // Assert
        results.ShouldEqual(1313);
    }
```

**Code sample:** *Ùsing* **Should** *makes the assertions more readable* 

### Why test-driven development matters

Developing code using TDD gave us the benefit of not needing to start up a full-running system in order to
try out a local change. Short Unit-Test will immediately confirm a theory, and uncover breaking changes in other areas of the code.

*Test-driven approach gives early warnings of breaking changes and helps see which libraries are covered by tests.*

![Test-driven approach gives early warnings]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/powel/3003663e3c2a86a4fd6031e615f6cec3.png)  


Even though code-coverage doesn’t uncover any quality issues, it was used in the
SmartWater project as an indicator of potentially problematic code. Libaries dealing with IO have a very limited set of
unit-tests. 

>**Note:** Load testing will be implemented once the team has sorted out an AD
tenant to use in the CI environment.

#### Continuous Integration

Having all the unit-tests run during a bulid stage in VSTS means we can stop the code from going into production if a unit-test fails.
Unit-tests are run continuously on each commit.

*Build report from VSTS*

![Build report from VSTS]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/powel/exampleBuildReport.png)



## Fast ring / production deployment

We decided to give the tenants the option to receive updates to the program in a
similar fashion to that of Windows 10. By providing the customer with a “Fast”
update option, they will, through their own configuration, be able to work on a
newer, “unreleased” version of the product. This gives us the ability to gather
feedback and metrics on that feature before deciding to release generally.

This was achieved by a simple configuration approach:

Each API is versioned. For example, the API for retrieving infrastructure data
has the following address:

**https\:\<baseUrl\>v1/LeakageZones/\{tenantId\}**

A new version of the same API containing a change would then appear as:

**https\:\<baseUrl\>v2/LeakageZones/\{tenantId\}**

The API clients are configured with a value for *BaseUrl*,
*ApiVersion* and *FastVersion*, and based upon the preference of the tenant,
they then read out the *FastVersion* to use the newest feature, or *ApiVersion*
if they haven’t opted in for early releases.

Once a feature is ready for general release, the *ApiVersion* and *FastVersion*
both point to the same values.


## Future plans, going forward

As in most hackfests, we did not have the time to do everything that we set out to do, so
in this section are the items that the rest of the team committed to follow up. 


### Ensuring all features have their acceptance criteria defined
During the hackfest, we did not have time to detail these, but this is marked for follow-up soon after.


### Implementing the release strategy
Even though we landed a strategy for a fast ring/slow ring release, we only managed to complete
the configuration part, and still need to design a page for the user to actually set this value. Some work remains on this, but 
nothing too complicated. 


### Monitoring in production with Application Insights
This point was spoken of, but we didn’t have time to address it during the
hackfest.

We are planning a Skype session to go through Application Insights and deliver
on the promise of getting vital production data from the system in production.

The general idea is to use Application Insights to track performance, custom
events, and to detect unforeseen problems.


### Planned tests 
Another follow-up is the use of test management capabilities in VSTS in order to
plan and execute tests.

The acceptance criteria made by the design team will be created as test plans in
VSTS that are executed once the feature has been delivered. These test plans
attach easily to the feature description in VSTS.

The test plans cover both functional tests as well as non-functional tests, such
as load testing and usability testing.


## Conclusion
After the hackfest, Powel is now able to plan, design, develop, and a release a
new feature within days. Minor changes and fixes can be put into production in minutes!

We estimate an average feature to have an average lead time of 34 days or less, which 
is a significant improvement to the %C&A. It is twice the current team speed, and we expect the lead 
time to drop even further as everyone starts getting into “the flow.”

With VSTS, each project stakeholder can now follow a feature as it flows through each of
the teams and into production, gaining insight into their development process
and adjusting as they go. With the VSTS build and release system hooked into Slack, everyone 
will see a notification when something new is released.

Adding acceptance criteria and considering security *before* a feature is
developed add up to a workflow with a much higher %C&A, as developers can see the
requirements and meet them at once. 

In order for all of this to happen, the developers adopted modern styles of software development, forming the basis
of a healthy codebase that is easy to maintain and easy to understand for new
developers joining the team. The SOLID form, combined with DDD and TDD, makes the grounds 
for a SmartWater that can grow in complexity, but never drops in its simplicity.

See [https://github.com/digitaldias/SmartWater.SettingsApi](https://github.com/digitaldias/SmartWater.SettingsApi) for a full vertical example
of the *SmartWater.SettingsApi*. It contains many of the principles discussed here. 
Access keys and other secrets have been masked out, but other than that, the code is complete.

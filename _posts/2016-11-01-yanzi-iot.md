Our need to be flexible and mobile and work in an agile way demands that we 
be able to prioritize. Being productive is a function of doing things in the 
right order. This can vary from day to day and often depends on the needs for 
that specific moment.

Still, we get used to doing things the same way every day. When someone cleans an office, for example, they might start with the first room and work their way systematically through the others. But in an open 
office landscape, some areas might not have been used that day. Why clean the area again if no one has used it?

What if we knew that an area had been used a lot during the day and could 
prioritize it for more deep cleaning? What if all wastebaskets 
that needed emptying would signal this, and the cleaner would get a live report showing exactly when a basket is emptied and automatically creating a sign-off report?

Today we can put sensors on a lot of things and they can return different 
kinds of data. With this in mind, Microsoft worked with Yanzi Networks, Coor, and 
Intel to showcase how to easily set up a grid of sensors and 
deploy them in Azure to follow different activities.

The array of Yanzi Networks sensors is automatically configured and in just a few hours can be installed in
a full-sized office and be up and running, with sensor 
data being transferred to an Azure implementation where you can easily monitor your data. With enough data, you can even predict 
when different scenarios may occur.

Coor can get this information into their planning phase for each worker, 
helping them focus on the areas of importance and ensure that more frequently 
used office areas are prioritized.

## Customer ##

## Pain points or benefits of use ##

Yanzi Networks has developed a software 
and networking platform for IoT including sensors and network infrastructure. 
Several Yanzi products, primary gateways and cloud servers run on Intel 
hardware platforms, which makes Yanzi part of the Intel ecosystem for IoT.

Yanzi's expertise lies in the device management and collection of data in a 
secure way, from sensor to cloud. Currently, the Yanzi 
platform does not provide a platform for analyzing and visualizing 
the information. **Yanzi needed a simple way to get 
customers up and running and be able to quickly start the analysis of the 
office data.**

Microsoft Sweden's facilities are managed by Coor, which made it natural to 
start implementation of the solution here. It has been partly implemented, and a 
project to develop the service further is ongoing. In the long run, **Coor 
believes that this kind of solution will be a fundamental tool for any 
activity-based workplace to ensure control of facility and real estate 
management as well as space utilization**.

The benefit of the end-to-end solution for a supplier of facilities management like Coor lies primarily in two areas:

- Coor has an advisory service function that explicitly works with developing 
new, smarter workplaces with a customized, activity-based approach. To develop 
a customized workplace, the key is to have a granular analysis of actual need for workspaces and this solution could measure the utilization in an efficient way. It would put the facts on the table and be a strong tool in creating and 
anchoring the future workplace need—both from a physical and behavioral 
perspective.

- Coor also believes this kind of solution will give their customers a better 
service delivery when operating a facility. It will be a cost-effective solution 
that Coor can offer to their customers, which guarantees a customized 
service delivery based on actual need, rather than frequencies decided 
beforehand. Coor sees enormous potential and a wide variety of possible 
functionality—from notifying when the coffee beans will run out to detailed space management analysis revealing whether the current location 
really can handle a planned expansion of the workforce.

## Solution ##

This project has three objectives:

- To implement an IoT solution for facility management at the sample office, i.e. Microsoft's office in Sweden.
- Learn from it and extract a general template for creating this solution in other situations and places.
- Create a simulated environment for testing the solution prior to installing any real Yanzi Networks sensors.

### Facility management ###

The solution focuses on collecting information from sensors, both for 
*real time* (website) and *batch* (Power BI) analysis.

Two types of data are collected: *status*, with the interval of one minute, and 
*events*, when a status has changed. They are collected for the following:

- Temperature (status)
- Humidity (status)
- CO2 (status)
- Desks (event, free/occupied)
- Conference rooms (event, free/occupied)
- Toilets (event, free/occupied)

## Architecture ##

Yanzi Networks installed 140 sensors on the first floor of the Microsoft building. 
It was a combination of sensors collecting temperature, motion, CO2, and 
humidity. The installation took about 2.5 minutes per sensor. This allows for super efficient physical deployments of sensors.

Motion sensors were used to register whether an area, such as a conference room, 
desk, or toilet, was occupied.

This is one of the areas in the Microsoft office where all desks are monitored.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/yanzi-desks-overview.jpg" width="700">


A motion sensor is installed beneath each desk.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/yanzi-desk-sensor.jpg" width="700">


One or two motion sensors were needed in each room, depending 
on the size of the room. Here the sensor has been mounted onto the wall. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/yanzi-room-sensor.jpg" width="700">


Yanzi Networks cloud servers collect the sensor information and send 
it by the Yanzi gateway to an [Event Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/services/event-hubs/) 
in Azure. ([IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/services/iot-hub/) can also be used 
depending on the need). The development adjustments of the Yanzi gateway 
to communicate with Azure was also part of this project. The gateway is 
done in Java and deployed on a Linux server. (The Yanzi gateway code 
is not part of the GitHub repository.)

### Regarding the choice between Event Hub and IoT Hub ###

The solution is built to support both types of gateways, but for the current solution we decided 
to use Event Hub. 

* It is only one device (channel) from the Yanzi Gateway to the Event Hub, of course 
secured with its own key.
* Yanzi itself has a very good device management solution, including certificates 
for each device and over-the-air upgrades. (This is part of their core offering.)
* It has an archiving function.
* It is a more economical solution with this load.

#### When to choose the IoT Hub? ####

* When more devices are added to the solution—for example, from other manufactures, 
especially if they don’t have good device management.
* When features that IoT Hub has, such as file transfer, are needed. 
* When a more predictable cost is needed.

An Azure Stream Analytics job reads from the Event Hub/IoT Hub and processes the 
information, mainly by transferring it to different sources. The Stream 
Analytics job sends the information to an Azure Service Bus topic for real-time 
information and to an Azure SQL Database for business analysis.

A web application, hosted in Azure as a web app, is listening to the events from 
the Service Bus topic queue and sends the events to a web page using a 
web socket connection. The web page contains an SVG map of the office and 
updates the map using the information in the events.

The real-time visualization is a good way to see which desks and conference 
rooms are available. Real-time visualization is one productivity 
key for an office worker and will drive usage of otherwise unused areas 
when those are a bit further away from the main parts of the office.

![Floormap]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/yanzi-floormap.png "Floormap")

We added an optional Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app. It can easily be installed on an Intel Stick 
and added to a monitor or a TV as shown below. 

![Realtime Floormap viewer]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/yanzi-uwp-tv.png "Realtime Floormap viewer")

Because the application is very lightweight, we also tried the solution using a 
Raspberry Pi to drive the display of the real-time floor map on a large screen. 
(This app is found in the GitHub repository.)

A [Power BI](http://www.powerbi.com) dashboard was created to host visualizations of the data. It 
uses the SQL Database as its source and primarily illustrates an overview 
of the office use.

![Power BI Dashboard]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/yanzi-powerbi-1.png "Power BI Dashboard")

Diving into the picture, we can see several things:

Some KPIs over current usage.

![Power BI KPI]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/yanzi-powerbi-2.png "Power BI KPI")

A list of all the different sensors, sorted on usage.

![Power BI Usage]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/yanzi-powerbi-3.png "Power BI Usage")

At the top, a graph that correlates use this week against average use.

![Power BI Utilization]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/yanzi-powerbi-4.png "Power BI Utilization")

Below is a heatmap superimposed on top of the floorplan, indicating the 
usage of the individual desks, conference rooms, and toilets. It goes from 
blue to red—where blue is very low usage and red is very high.

![Power BI Heatmap Utilization]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/yanzi-powerbi-5.png "Power BI Heatmap Utilization")

In the rightmost column, we see three different views on usage:

- Top: By type, such as desks, conference rooms, and toilets.
- Middle: By time per weekday, so we can compare over the course of a day between weekdays.
- Bottom: A trending overall usage per week.

![Power BI Utilization]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/yanzi-powerbi-6.png "Power BI Utilization")


This view shows data from the different environmental sensors.

![Power BI over time]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/yanzi-powerbi-7.png "Power BI over time")

The graphs, all by time per weekday, hold data from a screenshot taken in October 2016. The graphs show:

- Carbon dioxide levels. Note that it’s not until Saturday 
at 18:00 that we reach the «low» level. (Work days in Sweden are Monday – Friday).
- Temperature. Here we see that both people and time of day influence temperature. (Weather 
such as sun/no sun affects the overall temperature as well.)
- Humidity. It varies little and it’s hard to draw any conclusions.

If we go beyond the individual trends and look at the values themselves, 
we can see that the office is good at maintaining a healthy and steady 
working climate.

### Security ###

This solution relies on Yanzi for endpoint security of devices. It is a highly 
secure solution with all links being authenticated with client and server certificates 
and all communication made using SSL encryption. Each device has an individual 
key and can be revoked remotely. Yanzi is also responsible for the update strategy of firmware. 

The access to the data is done through user authentication within an Azure Active Directory. 
(In the example, this is not enabled for the real-time website, only for the Power BI dashboard.)

The Event Hub endpoint is secured with a symmetric key for each gateway. All internal 
connections between services also use unique shared access policies with minimal claims.

The data is stored in two places: 

1. SQL Database, where auditing and other security features can be leveraged. 
2. Azure Storage, using the security features that this service provides.

### Privacy ###

This solution doesn't collect any personal information, especially in the Microsoft installation,
where an open office policy is in place. But if this solution is used in other settings, it 
could indirectly collect personal information. For example, if each person has his/her own
workspace.

Also, be aware that if this data is combined with other data sources, such as 
new types of sensors or use of other services, such as Office 365, the privacy 
concerns need to be evaluated.

Always use data with precaution and always think about how the data can be used. 

### Deeper technical description ###

![Architecture Diagram]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/yanzi-architecture.png "Architecture Diagram")

#### Event Hub ####

Yanzi Networks has a gateway that transfers all messages (called "samples" in their system) 
into Azure, using an Event Hub. (We could also use an IoT Hub, but we do not need device management or commands in version 1.0 of this solution.)

The Event Hub stores all incoming messages into [Azure Blob storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/services/storage/). The messages stored there are not actively used today. They will be used to transfer data into Big Data Analysis in the future, though.

#### Stream Analytics ####

A [Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/services/stream-analytics/) 
job reads the messages from the Event Hub and converts and transfers 
these messages from Yanzi to four outputs:

- Two outputs into a [SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/services/sql-database/).
- A [Service Bus](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/services/service-bus/) that the Web Server is listening to. It is used to update the real-time floor map.
- A Service Bus topic that transfers all admin messages to a WebJob that updates 
reference data in the SQL Database.

An Azure Blob is also used as an input to Stream Analytics. It contains additional 
reference information about the sensors and is used by joining it with the stream 
to produce richer output.

#### SQL Database ####

The database is used for two things: 

- Store reference data about all sensors (assets).
- Be the source for Power BI reports.

##### Tables #####

Three tables are used in the database:

- **Asset.** The information about the sensors.
- **LastKnownSampleStatus.** Contains the latest sample from each sensor.
- **Samples.** The samples history.

The solution uses only stored procedures to communicate with the database.

#### WebJobs ####

Most of these [WebJobs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/websites-webjobs-resources/) 
can be migrated to [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/functions-reference/) 
when functions are available and mature. Because SQL Server Agent is not available for SQL Database, the WebJob approach 
is the best way of calling stored procedures on a schedule.

##### Create Snapshot (webjob-snapshot-sql) #####

This WebJob is executed every 10 minutes, providing a snapshot of the 
status for event type sensors in the table *LastKnownSampleStatus* and storing that information 
in *Samples*. For this solution, this is the best way to store data points every 10 minutes, which is needed for Power BI to produce accurate usage reports.

For status type sensors (such as temperature and humidity), a Stream Analytics query 
with a [tumbling window](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/stream-analytics-window-functions/) 
of 10 minutes is used.

##### Admin (webjob-admin-worker) #####

It listens to admin messages from the Admin Service Bus topic and updates the table *Asset*
accordingly.

#### Web Application ####

A [web app](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/services/app-service/web/) is used to view the real-time 
display of a floor. When it starts, it first gets the current status of all 
assets from SQL Database and then starts listening on the Service Bus topic.

It uses WebSockets ([SignalR](http://signalr.net/)) to communicate with the browser. The floor map is stored as an
SVG file and is updated with Javascript and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), the same framework that Power BI uses 
for visualizations.

#### Universal Windows Platform App ####

An app is created that hosts the website, and that app is installed on a Raspberry Pi, running
[Windows IoT Core](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot), 
or on an Intel Stick, running the desktop version of Windows 10.

Because the [Universal Windows Platform (UWP)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide) 
app uses [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/), it is available for all relevant mobile devices as well.

#### GetInformationFromCirrus ####

This is a Windows console application that gets sensor information from Yanzi (their API is called
"Cirrus") and sends it to the Admin Service Bus topic. 

This temporary solution is being used right now to get it to work until Yanzi has 
implemented support for admin messages.

#### UpdateAsaRefData ####

This is a Windows console application that creates a reference blob that Stream Analytics 
uses. This is a temporary solution for now.

#### Simulator ####

The simulator has two responsibilities. It initializes the solution with sensor data and it simulates 
messages from the Yanzi gateway.

## Devices used and code artifacts ##

### Yanzi Networks sensors ###

All sensor products are multi-sensor solutions with duplex communication and over-the-air upgrades. Each sensor communicates wirelessly every minute with a local gateway. This local gateway communicates with Yanzi's cloud.

The following sensors are used in this solution:

* Yanzi Motion (motion, acceleration, temperature)
* Yanzi Air (CO2, temperature, humidity)
* Yanzi Climate (temperature, humidity)

### Deployment of the simulated solution ###

> **Be aware** that there will be a charge to run this solution in Microsoft Azure.

This deployment script will create the following artifacts:

- Event Hub
- Stream Analytics job
- Service Bus with two topics
- SQL Database
- Storage account
- Web app for real-time floormap visualization 
- Admin WebJob
- SQL Snapshot WebJob
- WebJob that hosts the Yanzi Networks simulator

It will not install the Power BI reports because this is not currently possible to do through scripting.

#### Requirements ####

* Windows / Mac / Linux
* Node.js installed ([available here](https://nodejs.org/en/))
* An [active subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) to [Microsoft Azure](http://www.azure.com)

  `npm install -g azure-cli`

3 Choose account and subscription in which to install the solution. 

  3.1 First, log in to Azure. 

      `azure login`

  3.2 Check to see if you have several subscriptions on your account.

      `azure account list`

  3.3 Look in the **current** column to see if the right subscription is set.

    If not, then use `azure account set` to change the subscription.

4 Start the installation of the solution. 

  4.1 Go to the **deployment** directory.

  4.2 Type

    `npm install
    node deploy`

  You must provide this information:

  - A prefix. Used in namespaces and URLs to make names globally unique. (Keep it short, 
maximum of five characters.)
  - The name of the [Resource Group](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-overview/) in which the solution will be hosted.
  - Region where it should be deployed.

  It will take 5 to 10 minutes to deploy the solution. Below is a shortened screen capture
of this deployment.

## Conclusion ##

Sensors can give us data, and data can be collected and stored. But it is when we use the data, 
turn it into insights, and illustrate it in the right way and in the right 
format that it becomes valuable. With this project we wanted to illustrate how to set up an 
office space with sensors, easily deploy a solution to both collect and store 
the data, and get insights from the data.

Deploying the back end in Azure is easily done with ARM templates in just a few 
minutes, and insights can be viewed and drilled down into by using Power BI. Real-time 
information can be shown using tiny Rasberry Pi devices and a UWP app. The solution works 
both with Event Hub and IOT Hub and anyone can hook into the dataflow to add new 
functionality and more value to the solution.

The code is provided as a sample. It can be used as a starting point for anyone 
wanting to explore the world of IoT.

### Future ###
This is only the beginning—we hope to take this solution even further. With this platform, 
it will be easy to start building systems that are integrated with Office 365, allowing 
better management of, for example, conference room bookings. Further along, it can also 
be used to send commands back to control and automatically manage the building—for 
example, change the air ventilation if CO2 levels are too high.

 We (Microsoft) have included this in our experience tour 
that we have for customers who visit us here in Sweden. This gives customers a feel for IoT in place in a very easy way.
We are taking the bits to customers and kick-starting lots of projects in many 
different verticals. The uptake has been fantastic. 
An easy way to get started, understand the benefits, and grow at your own pace.

Feel free to use the bits to play with and learn how this will fit you in the best of ways.

Have fun!
